labelStackTrace = If you would like to file a bug report, copy-and-paste the text below along with a short explanation of how you encountered this bug at

titleDisclaimers = Disclaimers
labelGeneralDisclaimer = DISCLAIMER FOR EVERYONE:
textGeneralDisclaimer = You may hear occasional popping in-game after patching your ROM, for example while saving your game. Throughout 100+ hours of testing, these same pops were heard while playing the original Japanese release, making us fairly confident this hack isn't the cause. It's possible these audio glitches were covered up by the original mixer's background noise and are now easier to hear with clearer audio. Please don't hesitate to report any bugs, but just keep in mind there's only so much you can do with the GBA's limitations!
labelSpeedrunDisclaimer = DISCLAIMER FOR SPEEDRUNNERS:
textSpeedrunDisclaimer = If you're patching a Fan Translated ROM, the game's RNG will be modified to fit the new mixer into RAM alongside the translations; this may give you unexpected results during gameplay and will certainly break any TAS recordings of MOTHER 3 you've made!
